{"id":"1","clusterStateId":"none","question":"What is an index?","expectedAnswer": "An index is a collection of documents that have similar characteristics. For example, you can have an index for customer data, another index for a product catalog, and yet another index for order data. An index is identified by a name (that must be all lowercase) and contains a mapping that defines multiple fields within the documents. It also contains settings like the number of shards and replicas."}
